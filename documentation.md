# PLUGH.js - Text Adventure Game Engine Documentation

## Overview
PLUGH.js is a lightweight text adventure game engine that provides an interactive command-line interface for creating and playing text-based adventure games in the browser. It handles room and object management, user input processing, and game state tracking.

## Core Concepts
- **Rooms**: Locations in the game world, containing descriptions and objects.
- **Objects**: Interactive items in the game that can be examined, picked up, or used.
- **Player**: The entity controlled by the user, with an inventory system.
- **Commands**: Text-based inputs parsed into actions.
- **Game State**: Persistent variables tracking progress and conditions.

## Initialization
To initialize the game engine, create an instance of `PLUGH`:
```js
game = new PLUGH("#game-container");
game.init();
```
This will attach the game interface to the specified DOM element and set up the command-line interface.

## Rooms
Rooms represent locations in the game world.
```js
const room1 = new Room("forest", "Dark Forest", {
    desc: "A dark and mysterious forest.",
    intro: "You step into the eerie darkness of the forest."
});
```
### Managing Rooms
- **Add a Room**:
  ```js
  game.addRoom(room1);
  ```
- **Load a Room**:
  ```js
  game.loadRoom("forest");
  ```

## Objects
Game objects can be placed in rooms and interacted with.
```js
const torch = new GameObject("torch", "a flickering torch", {
    sight: "The torch casts a warm glow.",
    take: function() {
        game.player.inventory.addItem(this);
        return "You pick up the torch.";
    }
});
```
### Managing Objects
- **Add an Object to a Room**:
  ```js
  room1.addObject(torch);
  ```
- **Retrieve an Object**:
  ```js
  const obj = game.getObject("torch");
  ```

## Player
The player object tracks inventory and game state.
```js
const player = game.player;
player.inventory.addItem(torch);
```
### Inventory Management
- **Add Item**:
  ```js
  player.inventory.addItem(torch);
  ```
- **Remove Item**:
  ```js
  player.inventory.removeItem(torch);
  ```
- **Check Item**:
  ```js
  const hasTorch = player.inventory.getItem("torch");
  ```

## Commands and Input Handling
The engine supports text input for interacting with objects and navigating the world.
```js
game.commandLine.echo("Welcome to the adventure!");
```
### Handling User Input
- **Echo Output**:
  ```js
  game.echo("You see a dark cave ahead.");
  ```
- **Show Choices**:
  ```js
  game.showChoice([
    ["Enter the cave", () => game.loadRoom("cave")],
    ["Walk away", () => game.echo("You decide not to enter.")]
  ]);
  ```

## Game State Management
PLUGH.js tracks game state with flags.
```js
game.gameState("torchLit", true);
console.log(game.gameState("torchLit")); // true
```

## Saving and Loading
To save the game state:
```js
game.save();
```
This outputs a Base64-encoded string that can be stored and restored later.

## Credits
PLUGH.js was created by Ben Ehrlich, with further contributions by the open source community. The game jam game Desrosierâ€™s Discovery, for which this engine was created, was written by Ben Ehrlich and Isabel Stewart. The documentation for this game was created with the assistance of ChatGPT (sorry).
